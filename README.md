# Turning Waste into Value – Digital Twin-Driven Circular Systems in Industry 5.0

A perspective paper exploring how **digital twins** can transform **wastewater and process systems** under the **Industry 5.0** paradigm.  
Focuses on integrating **circular economy** principles and **adaptive modelling** to manage persistent contaminants such as **PFAS**.
